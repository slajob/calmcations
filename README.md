## our proposal

One of the most annoying thing while travelling is to pick a resturant or an actraction based on reviews to only discover later that the reviews were old or that somebody tricked the system by adding fake reviews.

So we have decidede to experiment with a different alogrithm to recommend nearby places.

The base idea is that a "spot" is warmed up by users, each "checkin" increase the spot heat.

The heat of a spot slowly dissipate till the point old checkins are irrelevant.

In such a way we would like to propose an algorithm that favour spots that have been popular in the recent times.


## TODO

- [ ] user actions
	- [x] create new point
	- [ ] checkin existing point
		- [x] create checkin
		- [x] tag:
	- [ ] query nearby points
		- [ ] sorting them by
		    - [ ] tag
		- [ ] query by location (not to load all of them)
    - [x] load fixtures


## preload fixtures

The algorithm proposed recommend spots based on previous users checkins.

To meaningfully use this app you should upload some data.

You can do so by running:
```
 curl -X POST \
 0.0.0.0:20778/api/mock-data \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --data-binary @mock_data.json
```
